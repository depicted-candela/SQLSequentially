-- Example 1: ROLLUP with One Column
-- Purpose: To calculate aggregate values (employee count, total salary) for each department
--          and a grand total across all departments.
-- `ROLLUP (d.departmentName)` creates two levels of aggregation:
--   1. Per d.departmentName
--   2. Grand total (d.departmentName is NULL in this grouping context)
SELECT
    -- The CASE statement uses GROUPING(d.departmentName) to determine the label.

    --   0 if d.departmentName is part of the current grouping key (i.e., a specific department row).
    --   1 if d.departmentName is aggregated/rolled up (i.e., the grand total row where d.departmentName is conceptually NULL).

-- Example 2: ROLLUP with Two Columns
-- Purpose: To calculate aggregates at multiple levels:
--          1. Per (departmentName, locationCity) - most granular.
--          2. Per departmentName (summing across its locationCities) - subtotal.
--          3. Grand total (summing across all departments and cities).
-- `ROLLUP (d.departmentName, d.locationCity)` follows a hierarchy:
--   (d.departmentName, d.locationCity)
