# 🚀 Master Sequential SQL: A Comprehensive, Self-Authored Journey into PostgreSQL 🚀

**Welcome! You've discovered more than just a collection of SQL notes – this is a meticulously crafted, complete learning system I built from the ground up, designed to take you from foundational concepts to advanced PostgreSQL mastery.**

Tired of surface-level tutorials that leave you with more questions than answers? Me too. That's why I didn't just *solve* exercises; I **created the entire curriculum** – from in-depth theoretical lectures to practical, hands-on exercises for every concept. My goal is to foster deep understanding, not just rote memorization.

This repository is a testament to a passion for SQL and a commitment to structured, comprehensive learning.

## ✨ What Makes This SQL Course Unique?

*   🌟 **Authored, Not Just Aggregated:** Every PDF lecture and accompanying exercise set was developed by me, ensuring a cohesive and progressive learning experience.
*   🧠 **Beyond Syntax – True Understanding:** We dive deep into the "why" behind SQL concepts, not just the "how."
*   🛠️ **Practical, Hands-On Learning:** Theory is immediately reinforced with custom-designed exercises to solidify your skills.
*   🐘 **PostgreSQL Focused, Universally Applicable:** While leveraging the power and advanced features of PostgreSQL, the core concepts learned are transferable to any SQL dialect.
*   📈 **From Novice to Pro:** A clear path from `BASIC` SQL fundamentals, through `INTERMEDIATE` techniques, to `ADVANCED` query wizardry and `COMPLEMENTARY` deep-dives.
*   📊 **Real-World Application:** Includes examples of how to visualize data insights using Metabase, connecting SQL power to business intelligence.
