# 🔗 SQL Joins Deep Dive: Mastering Connections & Combinations 🔗

Explore the world of SQL `JOIN` clauses! This comprehensive guide covers various join types (`CROSS JOIN`, `NATURAL JOIN`, `SELF JOIN`, `USING` clause), their meanings, advantages, disadvantages, and practical applications, culminating in a complex problem that ties these concepts together.

---

## 💡 1.1 Meanings, Values, Relations, Advantages of Joins

### Exercise 1.1.1: `CROSS JOIN` - Meaning & Advantage

> **Problem:** The company wants to create a list of all possible pairings of employee first names and available shift schedules to evaluate potential staffing options. Display the employee’s first name and the shift name for every combination.
>
> **Meaning:** A `CROSS JOIN` produces the Cartesian product of two tables, meaning every row from the first table is combined with every row from the second table.
> **Advantage:** Useful for generating all possible combinations between two sets of data, often for setup, testing, or comprehensive scenario planning.

```sql
SELECT e.first_name, s.schedule_id -- Displaying schedule_id as per query
FROM advanced_joins_aggregators.employees e
CROSS JOIN advanced_joins_aggregators.shift_schedules s;
```

### Exercise 1.1.2: `NATURAL JOIN` - Meaning & Advantage

> **Problem:** List all projects and their corresponding department names. The `projects` table has a `department_id` column, and the `departments` table also has a `department_id` column (which is its primary key). Use the most concise join syntax available for this specific scenario where column names are identical and represent the join key.
>
> **Meaning:** A `NATURAL JOIN` automatically joins tables based on all columns that have the same name and compatible data types in both tables.
> **Advantage:** Can lead to very concise queries when the join columns are identically named and are the intended join keys. Reduces verbosity.

```sql
SELECT p.project_name, d.department_name
FROM advanced_joins_aggregators.projects p
NATURAL JOIN advanced_joins_aggregators.departments d
ORDER BY p.project_name;
```

### Exercise 1.1.3: `SELF JOIN` - Meaning & Advantage

> **Problem:** Display a list of all employees and the first and last name of their respective managers. Label the manager’s name columns as `manager_first_name` and `manager_last_name`. Include employees who do not have a manager (their manager’s name should appear as `NULL`).
>
> **Meaning:** A `SELF JOIN` is a join where a table is joined to itself. It's used to compare rows within the same table or to relate hierarchical data stored in a flat table structure (like an employee-manager relationship).
> **Advantage:** Allows querying hierarchical relationships or making comparisons between different rows of the same table within a single query.

```sql
SELECT
    e1.first_name || ' ' || e1.last_name AS full_name, -- Aliased for clarity
    -- The CASE statement seems overly complex for simply getting the manager's name.
    -- A direct selection from e2 (manager's alias) would suffice.
    -- The condition `e2.first_name || ' ' || e2.last_name = e1.first_name || ' ' || e1.last_name`
    -- and the `ON` clause `e1.manager_id IS NULL OR e2.employee_id IS NOT DISTINCT FROM e1.manager_id`
    -- are not typical for a standard manager lookup. A simpler approach is usually:
    -- SELECT e.first_name || ' ' || e.last_name AS employee_name,
    --        m.first_name || ' ' || m.last_name AS manager_name
    -- FROM advanced_joins_aggregators.employees e
    -- LEFT JOIN advanced_joins_aggregators.employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id;
    -- The provided query attempts a NULL-safe join which might be specific.
    CASE
        WHEN e2.first_name IS NULL AND e2.last_name IS NULL THEN NULL -- Handle no manager
        WHEN e2.employee_id = e1.employee_id THEN NULL -- An employee cannot be their own manager in this context
        ELSE e2.first_name || ' ' || e2.last_name
    END AS manager_name -- Simplified CASE and alias
FROM advanced_joins_aggregators.employees e1
LEFT JOIN advanced_joins_aggregators.employees e2
    ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id; -- Standard self-join for manager
    -- Original ON: ON e1.manager_id IS NULL OR e2.employee_id IS NOT DISTINCT FROM e1.manager_id;
    -- This original ON clause logic is unconventional for a manager lookup.
    -- `e1.manager_id IS NULL` would try to join if employee has no manager, leading to many e2 rows.
    -- `e2.employee_id IS NOT DISTINCT FROM e1.manager_id` correctly handles NULL manager_id if it implies self-management or top-level.
    -- For a standard manager hierarchy, `e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id` with a LEFT JOIN on e1 is typical.
```
*Comment on provided query*: The `CASE` statement and `ON` clause in the original query for Exercise 1.1.3 are unusually complex for a standard manager lookup. A typical `LEFT JOIN` with `e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id` is more common. The provided solution might be trying to handle specific edge cases or has a different interpretation of "respective managers". The simplified version is shown in comments.

### Exercise 1.1.4: `USING` clause - Meaning & Advantage

> **Problem:** List all employees (first name, last name) and the name of the department they belong to. Use the `USING` clause for the join condition, as both `employees` and `departments` tables share a `department_id` column for this relationship.
>
> **Meaning:** The `USING` clause specifies a list of one or more columns that must exist with the same name in both tables being joined. The join condition is an equality comparison on these columns.
> **Advantage:** Provides a more concise way to write join conditions when the join columns have the same name in both tables, reducing redundancy compared to a full `ON` clause (`ON table1.col = table2.col`).

*(Query for 1.1.4 was not provided in the input snippets. A typical solution would be:)*
```sql
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name
FROM advanced_joins_aggregators.employees e
JOIN advanced_joins_aggregators.departments d USING (department_id);
```

## ⚠️ 1.2 Disadvantages of Join Concepts

### Exercise 1.2.1: `CROSS JOIN` - Disadvantage

> **Problem:** You were asked to get a list of employees and their department names. By mistake, you wrote a query that might produce an extremely large, unintended result if not for the small size of the sample `job_grades` table. Write this problematic query using `employees` and `job_grades` and explain the disadvantage. Then, show how many rows it would produce if `employees` had 1,000 rows and `job_grades` had 10 rows.
>
> **Disadvantage:** `CROSS JOIN` (or comma-separated tables without a `WHERE` clause, which implies a cross join) can lead to massive result sets (Cartesian product). If done unintentionally, it can consume significant system resources and produce meaningless data.

**Problematic Query (Implicit Cross Join):**
```sql
SELECT *  -- Easier to make this for error
FROM advanced_joins_aggregators.employees e, advanced_joins_aggregators.job_grades;
```
**Problematic Query (Explicit Cross Join):**
```sql
SELECT *  -- Same result than the previous but the word CROSS is more explicit, thus hard
FROM advanced_joins_aggregators.employees e -- to use it for error
CROSS JOIN advanced_joins_aggregators.job_grades jg; -- Added alias for clarity
```
> **Explanation from snippet:** This creates the Cartesian product between employees (15) and job_grades (5, assuming 5 grades for 75 items) with a size of 75 items. If employees were 1000 and job_grades 10: the Cartesian product would have 1000 * 10 = 10,000 items.

### Exercise 1.2.2: `NATURAL JOIN` - Disadvantage

> **Problem:** The `product_info_natural` table and `product_sales_natural` table both have `product_id` and `common_code` columns. Demonstrate how using `NATURAL JOIN` between them can lead to unexpected results or errors if the assumption about common columns is incorrect or changes. Assume you only intended to join on `product_id`. What happens if `common_code` values differ for the same `product_id` or if another common column is added later?
>
> **Disadvantage:** `NATURAL JOIN` relies on column names. If tables share more columns with the same name than intended for the join, the join condition becomes `table1.col1 = table2.col1 AND table1.col2 = table2.col2 AND ...` for all common columns. This can lead to fewer rows than expected or incorrect results if the additional common columns were not meant to be part of the join criteria. It also makes queries fragile to schema changes (e.g., adding a new column with a common name).

```sql
SELECT *
FROM advanced_joins_aggregators.product_info_natural pin -- Aliased
NATURAL JOIN advanced_joins_aggregators.product_sales_natural psn; -- Aliased
```
> **Explanation from snippet:** Prone to errors because if two (or more) column names between tables are common, the join happens on ALL of them. If they're not all dependent or intended for the join, the result could be different from the expected behavior if just one of the columns was desired to be the linking one. If `common_code` values differ for the same `product_id`, rows that should match on `product_id` might be excluded. If another common column (e.g., `last_updated_by`) is added to both tables later, `NATURAL JOIN` will start joining on that column too, potentially breaking the query.

### Exercise 1.2.3: `SELF JOIN` - Disadvantage

> **Problem:** When writing a query to find employees and their managers, if not careful, a `SELF JOIN` can become complex to read or write, especially with multiple levels of hierarchy or if the aliases are not clear. Illustrate a slightly more complex (but still basic) self-join requirement: Find employees who earn more than their direct manager. Point out how the logic, while powerful, could be misconstrued if not read carefully.
>
> **Disadvantage:** `SELF JOIN`s require careful use of table aliases to distinguish between the different roles the table plays in the join. The logic can become hard to follow, especially with multiple conditions or deeper hierarchies, increasing the risk of errors and making maintenance difficult.

```sql
SELECT
    e1.first_name || ' ' || e1.last_name AS employee_full_name, -- Aliased for clarity
    -- The CASE statement here is to avoid showing the manager's name if it's the same as the employee.
    -- However, the join condition e2.employee_id IS NOT DISTINCT FROM e1.manager_id should handle this.
    -- For "employees who earn more than their direct manager", we need manager's info.
    e2.first_name || ' ' || e2.last_name AS manager_full_name, -- Added manager name for context
    e1.salary AS employee_salary,
    e2.salary AS manager_salary
FROM advanced_joins_aggregators.employees e1
JOIN advanced_joins_aggregators.employees e2
    ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id -- Standard join for manager
    AND e1.salary > e2.salary; -- Condition for employee earning more
    -- Original ON: ON e2.employee_id IS NOT DISTINCT FROM e1.manager_id AND e1.salary > e2.salary;
    -- `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM` for manager_id is good if manager_id can be NULL and should match a hypothetical employee with NULL employee_id (unlikely).
    -- For direct manager, `e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id` is standard.
```
> **Explanation from snippet:** This is like spaghetti code, too hard to follow, maintain, and debug if deepness of linked self joins grow.
*(The provided query structure was slightly unusual with the `CASE`. The corrected query above is more standard for the problem stated.)*
The logic, while powerful, can be misconstrued if one doesn't carefully track which alias (`e1` or `e2`) refers to the employee and which to the manager, especially in the `WHERE` or `ON` clause conditions comparing their attributes.

### Exercise 1.2.4: `USING` clause - Disadvantage

> **Problem:** Suppose you want to join `employees` and `departments` but also need to apply a condition on the `department_id` from a specific table (e.g., `employees.department_id = 1`) within the `ON` clause for some complex logic (not a simple post-join `WHERE`). Show why `USING(department_id)` might be less flexible or insufficient for such a scenario compared to an `ON` clause.
>
> **Disadvantage:** The `USING` clause only allows for equi-joins on the named columns. It doesn't permit additional conditions within the join specification itself (like `AND table1.other_column = 'value'`). Such conditions must be placed in a `WHERE` clause, which might change the join semantics (e.g., for `LEFT JOIN`) or be less efficient if the condition could pre-filter rows before the join.

```sql
-- Scenario: Join employees and departments USING department_id,
-- but conceptually, one might want a condition on employees.department_id = 1 *within* the join logic.
SELECT *
FROM advanced_joins_aggregators.employees e
JOIN advanced_joins_aggregators.departments d
    USING(department_id) -- Joins on e.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE e.department_id = 1; -- This filter is applied *after* the join.
```
> **Explanation from snippet:** Despite it being possible (to filter post-join), it's less efficient than making the filtering on `departments` before making the join (if the filter was on `d.department_id`). In this case, the filter must be done after the join: less efficient.
> More precisely, if you used an `ON` clause, you could write `ON e.department_id = d.department_id AND e.department_id = 1`. For an `INNER JOIN`, the `WHERE` clause is often equivalent in outcome. However, for an `OUTER JOIN` (e.g., `LEFT JOIN`), placing the condition in `ON` vs. `WHERE` can yield different results. `USING` doesn't offer the `ON` clause's flexibility for such compound conditions directly within the join.

## 🔄 1.3 Lost Advantages: Inefficient Alternatives vs. Joins

### Exercise 1.3.1: `CROSS JOIN` - Inefficient Alternative

> **Problem:** A junior developer needs to generate all possible pairings of 3 specific employees (’Alice Smith’, ’Bob Johnson’, ’Charlie Williams’) with all available shift schedules. Instead of using `CROSS JOIN`, they write three separate queries and plan to combine the results manually in their application or using `UNION ALL`. Show this inefficient approach and then the efficient `CROSS JOIN` solution.

**Inefficient Approach (`UNION ALL`):**
```sql
-- Explicitly, using UNION ALL :
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, ss.shift_name
FROM advanced_joins_aggregators.employees e, advanced_joins_aggregators.shift_schedules ss -- Implicit cross join, then filter
WHERE e.first_name = 'Alice' AND e.last_name = 'Smith'
UNION ALL
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, ss.shift_name
FROM advanced_joins_aggregators.employees e, advanced_joins_aggregators.shift_schedules ss
WHERE e.first_name = 'Bob' AND e.last_name = 'Johnson'
UNION ALL
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, ss.shift_name
FROM advanced_joins_aggregators.employees e, advanced_joins_aggregators.shift_schedules ss
WHERE e.first_name = 'Charlie' AND e.last_name = 'Williams';
```

**Efficient `CROSS JOIN` Solution:**
```sql
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, ss.shift_name -- Corrected: select specific columns
FROM advanced_joins_aggregators.employees e
CROSS JOIN advanced_joins_aggregators.shift_schedules ss
WHERE
    (e.first_name = 'Alice' AND e.last_name = 'Smith') OR
    (e.first_name = 'Bob' AND e.last_name = 'Johnson') OR
    (e.first_name = 'Charlie' AND e.last_name = 'Williams')
ORDER BY
    e.last_name, e.first_name, ss.shift_name;
```
> **Explanation from snippet (for efficient solution):** Highly cleaner, but because the filtering is made *after* the cross join, the full Cartesian product between *all* employees and all shifts is computed first, then filtered. This could be less fast if the employee table is large.
> A potentially more optimized `CROSS JOIN` would be to filter employees first:
> ```sql
> SELECT e_filtered.first_name, e_filtered.last_name, ss.shift_name
> FROM (
>     SELECT first_name, last_name
>     FROM advanced_joins_aggregators.employees
>     WHERE (first_name = 'Alice' AND last_name = 'Smith') OR
>           (first_name = 'Bob' AND last_name = 'Johnson') OR
>           (first_name = 'Charlie' AND last_name = 'Williams')
> ) e_filtered
> CROSS JOIN advanced_joins_aggregators.shift_schedules ss
> ORDER BY e_filtered.last_name, e_filtered.first_name, ss.shift_name;
> ```
This pre-filters to only the 3 employees, then cross-joins with shifts, which is more efficient.

### Exercise 1.3.2: `NATURAL JOIN` - Avoiding for ”Safety” by being overly verbose

> **Problem:** A developer needs to join `product_info_natural` and `product_sales_natural`. They know both tables have `product_id` and `common_code` and they intend to join on both. They avoid `NATURAL JOIN` due to general warnings about its use and instead write a verbose `INNER JOIN ON` clause. Show this verbose solution and then the concise `NATURAL JOIN` (acknowledging that in this *specific* case, if the intent is to join on *all* common columns, `NATURAL JOIN` is concise, though still risky for future changes).

**Verbose `INNER JOIN ON`:**
```sql
SELECT pi.product_id, pi.common_code, pi.description, ps.sale_date, ps.quantity_sold
FROM advanced_joins_aggregators.product_info_natural pi
INNER JOIN advanced_joins_aggregators.product_sales_natural ps
    ON pi.product_id = ps.product_id AND pi.common_code = ps.common_code;
```
> **Explanation from snippet (for verbose):** Highly verbose when tables have the same column names for joining.

**Concise `NATURAL JOIN` (if appropriate):**
```sql
SELECT product_id, common_code, description, sale_date, quantity_sold -- No aliases needed for common columns
FROM advanced_joins_aggregators.product_info_natural pi -- Aliases can still be used for table reference
NATURAL JOIN advanced_joins_aggregators.product_sales_natural ps;
```
> **Explanation from snippet (for concise):** Less verbosity with less flexibility (as it joins on ALL common columns). In this specific case where joining on both `product_id` AND `common_code` is the intent, `NATURAL JOIN` is more concise. The risk remains if other unintended common columns are added later.

### Exercise 1.3.3: `SELF JOIN` - Inefficient Alternative: Multiple Queries

> **Problem:** To get each employee’s name and their manager’s name, a developer decides to first fetch all employees. Then, for each employee with a `manager_id`, they run a separate query to find that manager’s name. Describe this highly inefficient N+1 query approach and contrast it with the efficient `SELF JOIN`.
>
> **Inefficient N+1 Query Approach:**
> 1. `SELECT * FROM employees;`
> 2. For each employee `e` from the result:
>    If `e.manager_id` is not `NULL`:
>    `SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees WHERE employee_id = e.manager_id;` (This is the "+1" query, executed N times).
> This is highly inefficient due to multiple database roundtrips and repetitive querying.

> **Explanation from snippet:** Getting first every employee in a list to iterate along it to get their manager's name means N (number of employees) jobs (queries) and then select from the same table the employee coinciding with the manager's id duplicate the original selection of all employee's id with another selection: N + 1. This can be done copying and pasting the same sentence several times as is necessary or iteratively with procedural programming, but why if you can make a SELF JOIN?

**Efficient `SELF JOIN`:**
```sql
SELECT
    e1.first_name || ' ' || e1.last_name AS full_name,
    -- The CASE statement in the original snippet for 1.1.3 was complex.
    -- A simpler way to get manager's name, allowing NULL if no manager:
    e2.first_name || ' ' || e2.last_name AS manager_name
FROM advanced_joins_aggregators.employees e1
LEFT JOIN advanced_joins_aggregators.employees e2 -- e2 is the manager
    ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id; -- Join employee to their manager
    -- Original provided snippet for this section:
    -- ON e2.employee_id IS NOT DISTINCT FROM e1.manager_id;
    -- Using `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM` could be valid if `manager_id` itself could be `NULL` and
    -- it should match an employee with `employee_id IS NULL` (which is rare for primary keys).
    -- For typical manager lookups, `e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id` is standard with a LEFT JOIN.
```
> **Explanation from snippet (for efficient):** Simpler and highly less verbose with self join.

### Exercise 1.3.4: `USING` clause - Inefficient Alternative: Always typing full `ON` clause

> **Problem:** A developer needs to join `employees` and `departments` on `department_id`. Both tables have this column name. Instead of the concise `USING(department_id)`, they always write the full `ON e.department_id = d.department_id`. While not performance-inefficient, discuss how this makes the query longer and potentially misses a small readability/maintenance advantage of `USING`.

**Verbose `ON` clause:**
```sql
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name
FROM advanced_joins_aggregators.employees e
INNER JOIN advanced_joins_aggregators.departments d
    ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```
> **Explanation from snippet (for verbose):** This line adds the verbosity.

**Concise `USING` clause:**
```sql
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name
FROM advanced_joins_aggregators.employees e
JOIN advanced_joins_aggregators.departments d -- INNER is default for JOIN
    USING(department_id);
```
> **Explanation from snippet (for concise):** This line reduces verbosity.
> **Discussion:** Using `USING(column_name)` is more concise when join columns are identically named. It can improve readability slightly by reducing boilerplate. In terms of maintenance, if the column name `department_id` were to change *consistently* in both tables (e.g., to `dept_id`), you'd only need to update it in one place in the `USING` clause, versus two places in the `ON` clause. However, the primary benefit is conciseness. The `ON` clause remains more flexible for different column names or more complex join conditions.

## 🧩 1.4 Hardcore Problem Combining Join Concepts

### Exercise 1.4.1: Joins - Hardcore Problem

> **Problem:** The company wants a detailed report to identify ”High-Impact Managers” in departments located in the ’USA’. A ”High-Impact Manager” is defined as a manager who:
> a. Works in a department located in the ’USA’.
> b. Was hired on or before ’2020-01-01’.
> c. Manages at least 2 employees.
> d. The average salary of their direct reports is greater than $65,000.
>
> The report should list:
> * Manager’s full name (`manager_name`).
> * Manager’s job title (`manager_job_title`).
> * Manager’s department name (`department_name`).
> * The city of the department (`department_city`).
> * The number of direct reports (`num_direct_reports`).
> * The average salary of their direct reports (`avg_reports_salary`), formatted to 2 decimal places.
>
> Additionally:
> * Order the results by the manager’s last name.
> * Briefly comment on whether a `NATURAL JOIN` between `employees` and `departments` (if `department_id` was the only common column) or `departments` and `projects` (as `department_id` is common) would have been suitable and its risks.

```sql
-- Solution approach using CTEs for clarity:
WITH ManagerDirectReports AS (
    -- Select direct reports and their salaries, linking them to their manager
    SELECT
        mgr.employee_id AS manager_id,
        emp.salary AS report_salary,
        emp.employee_id AS report_id
    FROM advanced_joins_aggregators.employees emp -- This is the report (subordinate)
    JOIN advanced_joins_aggregators.employees mgr -- This is the manager
        ON emp.manager_id = mgr.employee_id
),
ManagerStats AS (
    -- Calculate stats for each manager: number of reports and average salary of reports
    SELECT
        manager_id,
        COUNT(report_id) AS num_direct_reports,
        AVG(report_salary) AS avg_reports_salary
    FROM ManagerDirectReports
    GROUP BY manager_id
)
SELECT
    m.first_name || ' ' || m.last_name AS manager_name,
    m.job_title AS manager_job_title,
    d.department_name,
    l.city AS department_city,
    ms.num_direct_reports,
    ROUND(ms.avg_reports_salary, 2) AS avg_reports_salary
FROM advanced_joins_aggregators.employees m -- Manager details
JOIN ManagerStats ms ON m.employee_id = ms.manager_id
JOIN advanced_joins_aggregators.departments d ON m.department_id = d.department_id
JOIN advanced_joins_aggregators.locations l ON d.location_id = l.location_id
WHERE
    l.country_id = 'US' -- Assuming 'US' is the country_id for 'USA' (or l.country_name = 'USA')
    AND m.hire_date <= '2020-01-01'
    AND ms.num_direct_reports >= 2
    AND ms.avg_reports_salary > 65000
ORDER BY
    m.last_name;

-- Comment on NATURAL JOIN suitability:
-- 1. NATURAL JOIN between `employees` and `departments`:
--    If `department_id` was the *only* common column name between them, `NATURAL JOIN`
--    would be equivalent to `JOIN ... USING(department_id)` or `JOIN ... ON e.department_id = d.department_id`.
--    It would be suitable and concise in that specific scenario.
--    Risk: If any other column (e.g., `location_id` if it existed in both with same name by chance,
--    or a generic `last_updated` column) was also common, `NATURAL JOIN` would include it
--    in the join condition, potentially leading to incorrect results or no results.
--
-- 2. NATURAL JOIN between `departments` and `projects`:
--    If `department_id` is the common column intended for the join, `NATURAL JOIN`
--    would be suitable *if and only if* no other columns share the same name between these two tables.
--    Risk: Similar to above. If, for instance, both tables had a `status` column with different meanings,
--    `NATURAL JOIN` would erroneously try to join on `status` as well, leading to flawed results.
--    Generally, explicit `ON` or `USING` clauses are safer and more readable regarding intent.
```

**Analysis of the provided snippet for 1.4.1:**
The snippet started with a CTE `managed_employees`.
```sql
-- Snippet's start:
WITH managed_employees AS (
    SELECT
        e1.employee_id AS managed_id, -- This is the ID of the employee who IS managed (the report)
        e2.employee_id,             -- This is e2, aliased as manager in the JOIN ON e2.employee_id = e1.manager_id
                                    -- So e2.employee_id is the manager's ID.
        e2.department_id,           -- This is the manager's department_id
		d.location_id,              -- This is from departments joined on e1.department_id (report's department)
		e1.salary md_salary         -- This is the salary of e1 (the report)
    FROM advanced_joins_aggregators.employees e1 -- e1 is the report
    JOIN advanced_joins_aggregators.employees e2 -- e2 is the manager
        ON e2.employee_id = e1.manager_id -- Correct: e1's manager_id links to e2's employee_id
    JOIN advanced_joins_aggregators.departments d
        ON d.department_id = e1.department_id -- This joins on the *report's* (e1) department.
                                               -- The problem asks for manager in dept in USA. So this should be manager's dept.
)
-- The main query then attempts NATURAL JOINs:
SELECT
	COUNT(*) direct_reports,
	e.first_name || ' ' || e.last_name full_name, -- This 'e' comes from NATURAL JOIN with managed_employees
	e.job_title, l.city, ROUND(AVG(me.md_salary), 2) avg_managed_salary
FROM managed_employees me
NATURAL JOIN advanced_joins_aggregators.employees e -- Will join on common columns e.g. employee_id, department_id
NATURAL JOIN advanced_joins_aggregators.locations l -- Will join on common columns e.g. location_id
GROUP BY full_name, e.job_title, l.city
ORDER BY full_name;
```
**Critique of Snippet's 1.4.1 Query:**
1.  **CTE Logic:**
    *   `managed_employees` correctly identifies manager-report pairs and the report's salary (`md_salary`).
    *   It includes `d.location_id` based on the *report's* department (`e1.department_id`). The problem asks for managers in departments located in the 'USA', so the manager's department is key.
2.  **Main Query `NATURAL JOIN`s:**
    *   `managed_employees me NATURAL JOIN advanced_joins_aggregators.employees e`: This is risky. `managed_employees` has `employee_id` (manager's ID from e2), `managed_id` (report's ID from e1), and `department_id` (manager's department from e2). `employees` table has `employee_id`, `department_id`. The `NATURAL JOIN` will likely try to join on `employee_id = employee_id AND department_id = department_id`. This would effectively try to match the manager's ID from `me` (aliased as `me.employee_id`) with `e.employee_id` AND the manager's department ID (`me.department_id`) with `e.department_id`. This part might correctly fetch the manager's details into `e`.
    *   `... NATURAL JOIN advanced_joins_aggregators.locations l`: `managed_employees` has `location_id` (from the report's department). `locations` table also has `location_id`. This join is based on the report's department's location, not necessarily the manager's if they are in different departments (though the CTE took manager's dept for `e2.department_id`). The CTE seems to mix contexts.
3.  **Filtering and Aggregation:** The snippet lacks the specific filtering criteria (hire date, country, report count, avg salary) and the aggregation is not correctly set up to group by manager to get their stats.

The solution provided *before* the snippet analysis is a more structured way to address the problem's requirements.
