		-- 1.2 (ii) Practice entirely their disadvantages of all its technical concepts
		
-- 		Exercise 1.2.1: (CROSS JOIN - Disadvantage)
-- Problem: You were asked to get a list of employees and their department names.
-- By mistake, you wrote a query that might produce an extremely large, unintended
-- result if not for the small size of the sample job grades table. Write this problem-
-- atic query using employees and job grades and explain the disadvantage. Then,
-- show how many rows it would produce if employees had 1,000 rows and job grades
-- had 10 rows.
SELECT *  -- Easier to make this for error
FROM advanced_joins_aggregators.employees e, advanced_joins_aggregators.job_grades;
SELECT *  -- Same result than the previous but the word CROSS is more explicit, thus hard
FROM advanced_joins_aggregators.employees  -- to use it for error
CROSS JOIN advanced_joins_aggregators.job_grades;
-- This creates the cartesian product between employees (15) and job_grades () with a size of
-- 75 items. If employees were 1000 and job grades 10: the cartesian product could have 10000
-- items

-- 		Exercise 1.2.2: (NATURAL JOIN - Disadvantage)
-- Problem: The product info natural table and product sales natural table
-- both have product id and common code columns. Demonstrate how using NATURAL
-- JOIN between them can lead to unexpected results or errors if the assumption about
-- common columns is incorrect or changes. Assume you only intended to join on
-- product id. What happens if common code values differ for the same product id
-- or if another common column is added later?
SELECT * 
FROM advanced_joins_aggregators.product_info_natural			-- Prone to errors because two column names
NATURAL JOIN advanced_joins_aggregators.product_sales_natural; 	-- between tables are common, if they're not
										-- dependent the result could be different to the expected behavior
										-- if just one of the columns is desired to be the linking one

-- 		Exercise 1.2.3: (SELF JOIN - Disadvantage)
-- Problem: When writing a query to find employees and their managers, if not
-- careful, a SELF JOIN can become complex to read or write, especially with multiple
-- levels of hierarchy or if the aliases are not clear. Illustrate a slightly more complex
-- (but still basic) self-join requirement: Find employees who earn more than their
-- direct manager. Point out how the logic, while powerful, could be misconstrued if
-- not read carefully.
SELECT  e1.first_name || ' ' || e1.last_name full_name, 
 	CASE 
 		WHEN e2.first_name || ' ' || e2.last_name = e1.first_name || ' ' || e1.last_name THEN NULL 
 		ELSE e2.first_name || ' ' || e2.last_name
	END	
FROM advanced_joins_aggregators.employees e1					-- This is like spaghetti code, to hard to follow,
JOIN advanced_joins_aggregators.employees e2					-- maintain, and debug if deepness of linked self
ON e2.employee_id IS NOT DISTINCT FROM e1.manager_id AND e1.salary > e2.salary;	-- joins grow

-- 		Exercise 1.2.4: (USING clause - Disadvantage)
-- Problem: Suppose you want to join employees and departments but also need to
-- apply a condition on the department id from a specific table (e.g., employees.department id
-- = 1) within the ON clause for some complex logic (not a simple post-join WHERE).
-- Show why USING(department id) might be less flexible or insufficient for such a
-- scenario compared to an ON clause.
SELECT * 
FROM advanced_joins_aggregators.employees e			-- Despite is possible, is less efficient than making the 
JOIN advanced_joins_aggregators.departments d		-- filtering in departments before to make the join. In this
	USING(department_id)							-- case the filter must be done after the join: less efficient.
WHERE e.department_id = 1;
